## How It Works

1. **Input or Trigger:** The user defines automation rules through the Appilot dashboard (e.g., “Play next from Jazz playlist” or “Auto-queue similar tracks”).  
2. **Core Logic:** The bot interacts with the Spotify app via UI Automator or Accessibility services to trigger the “Play Next” function on the desired track.  
3. **Output or Action:** Spotify plays the next queued song automatically, creating a continuous listening session.  
4. **Other Functionalities:** Error logging, retry logic, and queue optimization modules maintain smooth automation.
